							<p class="deskripsi">The Solar System is the sun and all the objects that orbit around it. The Sun is orbited by planets, asteroids, comets and other things.</p>
							<p class="deskripsi">The Solar System is about 4.6 billion years old. It formed by gravity in a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, and the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.</p>
							<p class="deskripsi">The Sun is a star. It contains 99.9% of the Solar System mass. This means that it has strong gravity. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The Sun is mostly made out of hydrogen, and some helium.</p>
							<p class="deskripsi">There are eight planets in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: <a id="mercury" onclick="home(mercury)" href="#coverContainer">Mercury</a>, <a id="venus" onclick="home(venus)" href="#coverContainer">Venus</a>, <a id="earth" onclick="home(earth)" href="#coverContainer">Earth</a>, <a id="mars" onclick="home(mars)" href="#coverContainer">Mars</a>, <a id="jupiter" onclick="home(jupiter)" href="#coverContainer">Jupiter</a>, <a id="saturn" onclick="home(saturn)" href="#coverContainer">Saturn</a>, <a id="uranus" onclick="home(uranus)" href="#coverContainer">Uranus</a> and  <a id="neptune" onclick="home(neptune)" href="#coverContainer">Neptune</a>. The first four planets are called terrestrial planets. They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants. This is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="kolomKanan">
							<p class="deskripsi">The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptunes orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be.</p>
							<p class="deskripsi">Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified or accepted dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris.In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites,usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.</p>

It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.</p></div><div class="kolomKanan"><p class="deskripsi">Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.</p><p class="deskripsi">Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.</p></div>';

Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. The position of Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier after his death</p></div></div>';
